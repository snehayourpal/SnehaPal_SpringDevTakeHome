_HaHa Heroes_, a local non-profit in the greater Atlanta area (note: this is a fictional non-profit), has volunteers assigned to different sub-projects they manage. These projects
are called _Hero Projects_. The non-profit has recently seen an uptick in the number of volunteers they manage and would like to a volunteer management system (VMS) to keep track of what projects volunteers are working on. _HaHa Heroes_ needs your help to build this system!
